And line added (I think) in branch called "mock_branch"

I did but only to ythe remote branch (of the same name)

It seem likely that branches are typically made locally first.

So I did that.... I made "mock_branch" locally.

Now let see if the remote branch and the local brach conflict somehow.... exciting!

OK
